# Shells & Cherries
This is an archive from a 2022 ROM hack I made for ROM hack races. It's built on top of [xkeeper disassembly](https://github.com/Xkeeper0/smb2). This hack was a complete overhaul of the game, with the goal that it would last 5-20 minutes depending on the skill level. A lot of new features were added to the game to make the experience much smoother for a race setting, while respecting that the game would still runs on the original [NES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System) and fitting the whole ROM size at a whopping 512kb. However, all of the changes I made could probably still fit in a ROM size of 256kb. The patch can be found in the [release section](https://github.com/Producks/Shell-N-Cherries/releases/tag/merio).
## Features
* Complete overhaul of the level
* Complete overhaul of the visuals
* Beta music was added to replace the previous underground theme
* Pressing start now act has a fast respawn
* Dying now quickly respawns you, acting the same as pressing start
* Removed the iframe freeze that would happen when taking damage

* Able to swap graphics bank directly into the levels
* And much more that I forgot...
